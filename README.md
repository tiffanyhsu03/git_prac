This article discusses an up and coming organization founded by Disney VP of Technology Nikki Katz
who has crafted the Rosie Program that give women an opportunity to switch careers in a technical
role. I find it interesting that the objective of this program CODE: Rosie is aimed to expose women
in non-technical roles to the field of software engineering. It is absolutely amazing that after
a three month training period, these select groupof women will go on to pursue a year long apprenticeship
at the company with the chance to take a job in one of Disney's technical groups. The mission of this
program revolves around a frequent conversation involving women who are passionate about tech but feel
that they have never received the opportunity to actually pursue it professionally.

When I initially read this article, it reminded me of another article that I read on planningpoker.com. It talks about how QA analysts should also know how to code/develop, as they are waiting for tickets to be assigned to them, at the beginning of a sprint, they technically have "nothing to do". Some manual QA analysts do not know how to code, so if a program like Rosie existed in some companies, it would definitely be less daunting for them to begin how to learn.
